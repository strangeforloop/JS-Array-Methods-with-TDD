## About 
This is an exercise to recreate the JavaScript Array.prototype methods using Test Driven Development. I gathered the specs needed for each method from their respective MDN documentation page. You can find the main page that links to each method's documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/tr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype#Methods).

The testing framework used for this is called [Tiny Test](https://github.com/joewalnes/jstinytest) which was created by Joe Walnes.
